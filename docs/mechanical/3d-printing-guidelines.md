# Guide to 3D Printing
General guidelines and requirements for 3D printing:

1. Get your [WATIMAKE 3D print certification](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/resources-and-services/mme-clinic/watimake).
2. Keep in mind the orientation of the 3D print to maximize strength of the part, minimize support materials, and maximize feature accuracy.
3. Consider the maximum build volume of the printer
4. Keep in mind warping – the back part of the printer nearer to the extruder is warmer. Maintaining constant temperature will prevent warping due to rapid cooling. Therefore, if certain features are important put them closer to the extruder than the door to maintain a constant environment.
5. Consider splitting large parts into multiple parts and using flanges/mating features to appropriately to attach together.
6. Consider the material your using. ABS is more prone to warping and is no brittle. PLA warps less and is brittle.
7. Filament is not cheap – consider the amount if infill, you should not be using more than 30% for a structural part.
8. Consider the amount of shells (number of outer layers before infill begins) that you need 4-6 layers is appropriate.
