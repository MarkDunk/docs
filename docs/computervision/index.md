#Welcome to the Computer Vision Docs!


##Installation
The installation process depends on what system you have. WARG-CV runs on Linux. However, in case you donâ€™t have Linux, we have premade a DockerFile, so that you can setup a virtual image on any system.
You may be able to get the project to compile on Mac OS X, but that is up to you to figure out.

If you don't have a Linux environment, don't worry! You can download a docker image. It is essentially a premade virtual machine.

* Go to [https://docs.docker.com/mac/](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) for Mac systems
* Go to [https://docs.docker.com/windows/](https://docs.docker.com/windows/) for Windows systems.

You can get our [docker image here](http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~warg/docs/docker.zip).

After completing the download and installing docker:
1) Unzip the package.
2)
